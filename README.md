RiffTheory

A web app for guitarists who want to sharpen their music theory.

Can't remember the minor scale in different positions on the fret board? Neither can I. That's why I created this app- to help guitarists better visualize scale and chord layouts all over the fretboard.

This app allows you to customize the fretboard by string and fret number, so that even if you have a 8 string guitar, you can still jam out the minor pentatonic scale over a backing track.

Deployment coming soon. 
TODO: Add more chord formulas to the app.
