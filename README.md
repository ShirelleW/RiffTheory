[A web app](https://riff-theory.vercel.app/) for guitarists who want to sharpen their music theory.

Can't remember the minor scale in different positions on the fret board? Neither can I. That's why I created this app- to help guitarists better visualize scale and chord layouts all over the fretboard.

This app allows you to customize the fretboard by string and fret number, so that even if you have a 12 string, 24 fret guitar, you can still jam out to the pentatonic scale over a backing track with the help of RiffTheory's visual aide. The app also allows for non E-standard guitar players to customize the fretboard to their tunings.  


Have Fun Jammin'!
